# dogrestapi
This is a REST API developed using Springboot.
The REST API gives clients the functionality of posting dog objects to the in-memory H2 database, retrieving list of dogs in the database, retrieving a dog object by it's ID, and other CRUD operations. 

This is a personal project to familiar myself with API development using Springboot and Java.
